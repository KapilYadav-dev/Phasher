# Phasher ‚úÖ

> So, around a week ago I was struggling to compare similarities between two images and found a way i.e Phash (perceptual hash) algorithm. It's based upon https://www.phash.org/.‚ù§Ô∏è

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

![latestVersion](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/KapilYadav-dev/Phasher)

### 1. Add dependency.
```groovy
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // Add jitpack
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.KapilYadav-dev:Phasher:Tag'
}

```

### 2. Use Phash() function.
#### 1st way using file path.
```kotlin
fun Phash(
    fileOnePath: String?, // path of Image one 
    fileTwoPath: String?, // path of Image two
    bitSize: Int = 8  // This is the size you want to resize, can play with it for more accuracy and its best with the value 8
)
```
#### 2nd way using file uri.
```kotlin
fun Phash(
    uriOne: Uri?, // Uri for Image one
    uriTwo: Uri?, // Uri for Image two
    context: Context
)
```
#### Finally use ```getSimilarityScore()``` method which will return % of confidence.
#### i.e.
```kotlin
val score = Phash(path1,path2).getSimilarityScore()
// score = 70 %
val scoreTwo = Phash(uri1,uri2,context).getSimilarityScore()
// score = 70%
```

## Results
| Image 1 | Image 2 |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="/img1.jpeg" width="200"/> | <img src="/img2.jpeg" width="200" /> |
## Result 89 % match ‚úÖ

## Important Note ‚úçÔ∏è
Choose your threasold for your image as per your usecase. <br>
For a standard one, we use 75 % threasold that means above its image are similar.
